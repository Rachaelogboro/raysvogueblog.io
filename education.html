        <h3>New Education Policy</h3>
        <p>The Education policy in each province is meant to ensure that a structure is in place
            which will allow for the development of the personal capacities of each individual.
            The educational structure will also facilitate the development of those skills needed
            by society, and inculcate and foster those values advocated by the community.
            The tension between these aims has resulted in controversies over various aspects
            of the structure of EDUCATION systems, including curriculum (especially concerning
            sensitive subjects, eg, religious instruction or sex education); rights of ethnic,
            linguistic and religious minorities; the extent and forms of public financial support
            at the local, provincial and federal levels; and the related question of government
            control relative to the rights of pupils or students, parents and teachers.</p>

        <h3>Protect our Children</h3>
        <p>On May 24, 2022, a mass shooting occurred at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde,
            Texas, United States, where 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, a former student at the school,
            fatally shot 19 students and two teachers, while 17 others were injured but survived.
            After shooting and severely wounding his grandmother at their home earlier that day,
            Ramos drove to the school. He fired shots for approximately five minutes outside the school,
            before entering unobstructed with an AR-15 style rifle through an unlocked side entrance door.
            He then shut himself inside two adjoining classrooms, without locking the classroom door,
            and killed the victims. Ramos remained in the school for more than an hour before members of
            the United States Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC) fatally shot him after bypassing numerous
            local and state officers who had been in the school's hallways for over an hour.</p>

        <h3>2022 Libraries pre-Budget Submission</h3>
        <p>With the Federation of Ontario Public Libraries (FOPL), we’ve submitted our 2022 Libraries
            Pre-Budget Submission. In order to get needed support our 2022 Budget Recommendation are:
            1. Keep local public libraries across Ontario sustainable.
            Enhance provincial operating funding for public libraries and ensure that this increased
            support reaches those libraries where it is most needed.
            2.Working alongside First Nations Public Library leaders, rapidly implement a sustainable
            funding model for public libraries on reserve to ensure that these important local hubs are
            fully-funded and viable. This includes increasing direct provincial funding support to sustainably
            fund library operations and ensure a living income for frontline library staff in these communities.
            3.Provide critical e-learning support and fair access to modern, digital resources for all Ontario public

        <h3>Education Today</h3>
        <p>On International Day of Education, we asked UCL School of Management staff, students and alumni what
            ‘education’
            means to them and why they believe it is so important.

            “Education is the only defense we have against demagogues, fake news, and echo-chambers gradually pushing us
            into a dystopian reality”
            Davide Ravasi, Director of the PhD Programme

            “Education, while being enjoyable, helps us broaden our horizons by equipping us with the knowledge
            necessary
            to better understand our surroundings as well as succeed in today’s world.”
            Nada Abi, 3rd Year BSc Management Science student

            “In my opinion, education is the single most important key to prosperity and a better future. By celebrating
            this important event today, it will hopefully grasp more attention with the ultimate goal to make education
            accessible to everyone on this planet.”
            "Benedikt Beckenbauer MSc Management alumni"
