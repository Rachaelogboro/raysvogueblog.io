        <h3>Chris Brown in court again?</h3>
        <p>Chris Brown is reportedly being sued by a former housekeeper over an alleged dog attack.

            According to documents seen by TMZ, the unidentified female housekeeper claims she was mauled by the
            singer’s Caucasian Shepherd Ovcharka, called Hades, while she was working at his home in December 2020.

            Per the report, the woman alleges that the dog attacked her while she was taking out refuse, tearing chunks
            of flesh from her body, face and arms.



            It is claimed that Brown was at home when the incident allegedly occurred, along with friends, but did not
            offer assistance to the housekeeper.

            Brown allegedly arranged for the dogs to be collected from the property before police and paramedics
            arrived. The dog was reportedly euthanised weeks later, after staff at the Humboldt County Sheriff’s Office
            Animal Shelter decided the animal was dangerous.

            The housekeeper is reportedly suing for major damages, claiming that extensive surgery was undertaken in
            order to save her life.

            Brown has yet to respond to the claims. The Independent has contacted Brown’s representatives for comment.

        <h3>The grammy award</h3>
        <p>The Grammys are normally an event where fashion rules don’t apply. Music’s biggest night boasts a
            red carpet parade of risque dresses, tongue-in-cheek outfits, and attempts to go viral. The outlandish
            spirit of the event makes for a lively pre-show, but 2022’s guests seemed eager to defy expectations.
            The stars who descended on Las Vegas’s iconic MGM Grand casino embraced the kind of glamour that wouldn’t
            have been
            out of place during the Rat Pack era. Dua lupa and Ariana grande was a personal favourite of mine, with
            their iconic dresses.
            and they sure lead the pack by arriving in full chanteuse mode, dressed in a black and white Armani Privé
            gown with a full train and piles of Tiffany & Co. diamonds.
